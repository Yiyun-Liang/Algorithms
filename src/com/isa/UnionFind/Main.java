     *  proof 1:
     *      Increases by 1 when tree T1 containing x is merged into another tree T2.
     *          The size of the tree containing x at least doubles since | T 2 | â‰¥ | T 1 |.
     *          Size of tree containing x can double at most lg N
     *
     *  Scalability:
     *      lgN is more scalablly acceptable
     *          because if in the future, computers are 10X faster,
     *          and we have a 10X larger dataset,
     *          our algorithm runs faster
     *
     *
     *  Ex. 10^9 unions and finds on 10^9 objects (1 billion)
     *      - WQUPC reduces time from 30 years to 6 seconds
     *      - supercomputers won't help much, good algorithms enables solutions
