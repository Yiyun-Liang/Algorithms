        Definitions of Graphs G = (V, E):

            1) directed graphs
                - have edges with directions
                - the edges indicate a one-way relationship
            2) undirected graphs
                - have edges that do not have directions
                - the edges indicate a two-way relationship
                - each edge can be traversed in both directions

            1) sparse graphs:
                - size(E) is much less than size(V)^2
                - prefer to be represented as a collection of adjacency-list (compact way)
            2) dense graphs:
                - size(E) is close to size(V)^2
                - prefer to be represented as a collection of adjacency-matrix
                    - able to tell quickly if there is an edge connecting two given vertices


         Representations of Graphs: P560 of Introduction to Algorithms
            1) adjacency list
                - contains an array (adj) of size(V) lists, one for each vertex V
                - foreach u in V, adj[u] contains all the vertices v such that there is an edge (u,v) in E
                  (contain all vertices v adjacent to u in G, or contain pointer to these vertices)
                - adj is often treated as an attribute of G, so G.adj[u]

                * directed graph:
                    sums of lengths of all the adjacency list is size(E)
                    (u,v) = having v appeared in adj[u]
                * undirected graph: sums of lengths of all the adjacency list is 2*size(E)
                    (u,v) = having v appeared in adj[u] and vice versa

                - for both types of graphs, memory required of adj list is O(V+E)

                * weighted graph with weight function w: E -> Real #
                    simply store w(u,v) with v in adj[u]

                - disadvantage: no quick way to determine whether a given edge (u,v) is present in G
                                than to search for v in adj[u]
            2) adjacency matrix
                - assume that vertices are represented as numbers from 1 to size(V)
                - then a size(V) * size(V) matrix is constructed such that A = aij such that
                    aij = 1 if(i,j) is in E
                    aij = 0 otherwise

                * directed graph:

                * undirected graph: sums of lengths of all the adjacency list is 2*size(E)
                    symmetry along the main diagonal of the adjacency matrix
                    the adj matrix A is its own transpose A = AT
                    sometimes only store entries on and above the diagonal to cut memory needed to half

                * weighted graph:
                    store weight w(u,v) of edge(u,v) as the entry in row u and column v
                    if edge does not existss, store null, 0, or infinity

                - disadvantages: more space/memory needed (use it for smaller graphs)
                - advantages: one bit per entry for undirected graphs, simpler
