# Algorithms

Some practice problems and notes I have been keeping while I am learning
algorithms and data structures.

# Random Notes

+ percolation problem, top row to bottom row, instead, have a vitural top and a virtural bottom so that the problem is simplified.

### Math
+ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = 1+2+...+n = n(n+1)/2
+ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i-1 = 1+2+...+(n-1) = n(n-1)/2

### Complexity Analysis
+ ϴ: tight, upper and lower bound
+ O: upper bound
+ π: lower bound
+ o: never-reached upper bound 

### Performance
+ multiplication vs. bit shifting: some compilers optimizes multiplication to bit shifting. For us, sometimes optimization compromises readability so choose wise.


### Truly Random Notes
- instead of using a dynamic array, can use a stack sometimes


### Getting Better
leetcode, topCoder, career cup, high scalability, Github GitBook (eg. coding interview university), Tech Blogs (eg. [cenalulu](http://cenalulu.github.io/)), 一亩三分地, 米群网, codeforce

industrial coding conventions, readability, concise, reusability, speed, edge case, bug free
